This is a quick and dirty intro into getting setup to run the Auction program.

We use Linux exclusively, openSUSE Leap 42.3, so you will need that to run the program.

If you don't have a spare machine for this, simply install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
and then go to [here](https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/42.3/iso/) to download the ISO for Leap 42.3.

You will want the openSUSE-Leap-42.3-DVD-x86_64.iso and no need to burn a DVD since you can mount it right in VirtualBox for installing.

You will need a sample database, as well, and a working install of MySQL (we use the MariaDB fork). We have a sample database in the source code tree under "external-tools" where you will also find the BASH scripts for updating the version numbering we use.

More detailed instructions will be added as soon as I can.
